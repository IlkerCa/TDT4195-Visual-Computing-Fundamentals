Task 3b

Observe the effect of modifying the value on the resulting rendered image. Deduce
which of the four distinct transformation types discussed in the lectures and the
book modifying the value corresponds to. Also write down the direction (axis) the
transformation applies to

change A:
Effect: The image is enlarged or reduced in width. 
Transformation: Scaling
Axis: x-axis

change B:
Effect: Tilts the image to the side
Transformation: Shearing
Axis: x-axis

change C:
Effect: Triangles slide left or right
Transformation: Translation
Axis: x-axis

change D:
Effect: One half of the image has been moved downwards, the other half upwards. Furthermore the triangles are tilted away from the center or toward the center. 
Transformation: Shearing
Axis: y-axis 

change E:
Effect: Triangles grow or shrink
Transformation: Scaling
Axis: y-axis

change F:
Effect: Triangles slide up or down
Transformation: Translation
Axis: y-axis
